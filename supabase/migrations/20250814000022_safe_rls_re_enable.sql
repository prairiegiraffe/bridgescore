-- SAFELY RE-ENABLE RLS WITH PROPER POLICIES
-- This migration will restore security without breaking app functionality

-- STEP 1: First create comprehensive RLS policies BEFORE enabling RLS
-- This ensures there's no moment where RLS is enabled without proper policies

-- ========================================
-- ORGANIZATIONS TABLE POLICIES
-- ========================================

-- Drop any existing policies to start clean
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organizations are viewable by members" ON organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organizations updateable by superadmins" ON organizations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organizations insertable by superadmins" ON organizations;

-- Policy 1: Members can view their organization
CREATE POLICY "Organizations are viewable by members" ON organizations
  FOR SELECT USING (
    id IN (
      SELECT org_id FROM memberships 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Policy 2: Only superadmins can update organizations
CREATE POLICY "Organizations updateable by superadmins" ON organizations
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM memberships 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND org_id = organizations.id
      AND is_superadmin = true
    )
  );

-- Policy 3: Only superadmins can insert new organizations
CREATE POLICY "Organizations insertable by superadmins" ON organizations
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM memberships 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND is_superadmin = true
    )
  );

-- ========================================
-- MEMBERSHIPS TABLE POLICIES  
-- ========================================

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Memberships viewable by org members" ON memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Memberships updatable by superadmins" ON memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Memberships insertable by superadmins" ON memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Memberships deletable by superadmins" ON memberships;

-- Policy 1: Users can view memberships in their organizations
CREATE POLICY "Memberships viewable by org members" ON memberships
  FOR SELECT USING (
    -- Users can see their own membership
    user_id = auth.uid() OR
    -- OR they can see other memberships in their orgs
    org_id IN (
      SELECT org_id FROM memberships 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Policy 2: Only superadmins can update memberships  
CREATE POLICY "Memberships updatable by superadmins" ON memberships
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM memberships m
      WHERE m.user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND m.org_id = memberships.org_id
      AND m.is_superadmin = true
    )
  );

-- Policy 3: Only superadmins can insert memberships
CREATE POLICY "Memberships insertable by superadmins" ON memberships
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM memberships m
      WHERE m.user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND m.is_superadmin = true
    )
  );

-- Policy 4: Only superadmins can delete memberships
CREATE POLICY "Memberships deletable by superadmins" ON memberships
  FOR DELETE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM memberships m
      WHERE m.user_id = auth.uid() 
      AND m.org_id = memberships.org_id
      AND m.is_superadmin = true
    )
  );

-- STEP 2: Update views to work properly with RLS
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS organization_details CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS membership_with_profiles CASCADE;

-- Recreate organization_details view that respects RLS
CREATE VIEW organization_details AS
SELECT 
  o.id,
  o.name,
  o.domain,
  o.primary_color,
  o.secondary_color,
  o.bridge_steps,
  o.openai_assistant_id,
  o.openai_vector_store_id,
  o.openai_model,
  o.demo_mode,
  o.created_at,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM memberships m WHERE m.org_id = o.id) as member_count
FROM organizations o;

-- Recreate membership_with_profiles view that respects RLS  
CREATE VIEW membership_with_profiles AS
SELECT 
  m.id,
  m.user_id,
  m.org_id,
  m.role,
  m.is_superadmin,
  m.created_at,
  u.email,
  u.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name' as full_name
FROM memberships m
JOIN auth.users u ON m.user_id = u.id;

-- Grant proper permissions on views
GRANT SELECT ON organization_details TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON membership_with_profiles TO authenticated;
